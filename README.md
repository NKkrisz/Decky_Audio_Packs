# What is this repository for?

I made this repository because I want to make some of my favourite music available in the [Steam Deck Audio Loader Plugin](https://github.com/DeckThemes/SDH-AudioLoader).  
Documentation on how to make your own packs is [available here](https://docs.deckthemes.com/AudioLoader/).

## C418 - Copyright & Where I Got The Music From

### [What am I allowed to do with Daniel’s (C418) music?](https://c418.org/2017/01/26/what-am-i-allowed-to-do-with-daniels-music/)
- You CAN use my music on your YouTube video/ Twitch stream
- You CAN monetize your YouTube video/ Twitch stream
- You CANNOT upload all my music as-is, monetize it and make money off of streaming all my music. This means you have to put in some creative work, be that a podcast or a video about some game you’re playing or a music video or whatever. Just don’t upload all my music and make money off my work through ads. That’d be SUPER rude
- You HAVE TO specify that my music is being used. Be that through having my credits in the description or by you mentioning it. If you are doing a stream of sorts and there’s no way you can put in that information, at least put in the energy to tell people that you’re streaming my music if someone’s asking
- You CANNOT make my music available to download for free. If the music is free on my end, please lead your people to the download page I offer
- I ASK YOU to at least purchase my music if you have the intent of using it for your video/stream/podcast or whatever
- If you have ANY questions about this list or what you can do with my music please reach out to my manager, at patmcdermott@gmail.com

### ***Original download pages will be listed below by me.***
### ***Only music he listed as free are available here.***  
### ***Please support him by buying his music!***
*Per above request, use the original pages for downloading his music, the only reason the files are here so I can submit them to the Audio Loader plugin.*
